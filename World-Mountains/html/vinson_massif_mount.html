  <p><span class="initial">V</span>inson Massif (is the highest mountain of Antarctica, located about 1,200 km (750 mi) from the South Pole. The mountain is about 21 km (13 mi) long and 13 km (8 mi) wide. At 4,892 metres (16,050 ft) the highest point is Mount Vinson, which was named in 2006 by US-ACAN.
    
    The southern end of the massif ends at Hammer Col, which joins it to the Craddock Massif, of which the highest point is Mount Rutford (4477 m).
    
    The massif lies in the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains, which stand above the Ronne Ice Shelf near the base of the Antarctic Peninsula.
    
    A high mountain, provisionally known as 'Vinson' was long suspected to be in this part of West Antarctica, but it was not actually seen until January 1958, when it was spotted by US Navy aircraft from Byrd Station. It was named after Carl Vinson (also the namesake of an aircraft carrier), a United States Georgia Congressman who was a key supporter of funding for Antarctic research.</p>

  <p> <span class="initial">T</span>he first measurement of the Vinson Massif was established in 1959 at the elevation of 5,140 m (16,864 ft).In the 1979-80 climbing season, a U.S.S.R. party consisting of two Germans and a Soviet climber reached the top and placed a red USSR flag and ski pole which assisted ground parties in establishing a more accurate height of 4,897 m (16,066 ft).n January 2001, a team sponsored by NOVA made the first ascent of the east face and after running GPS on the summit for 20 minutes, established a new height of 16,077 ft (4,900.3 m).The current height (4,892 m) resulted from a GPS survey by the 2004 Omega Foundation team comprising Damien Gildea of Australia (leader) and Rodrigo Fica and Camilo Rada of Chile.Since 1998 and continuing through 2007, the Omega Foundation has placed a GPS receiver on the summit for a suitable period of time to obtain accurate satellite readings.The climate on Vinson is generally controlled by the polar ice cap's high-pressure system, creating predominantly stable conditions but, as in any arctic climate, high winds and snowfall are a possibility. Though the annual snowfall on Vinson is low, high winds can cause base camp accumulations up to 18 inches in a year. During the summer season, November through January, there is 24 hours of sunlight. While the average temperature during these months is -20ÂºF, the intense sun will melt snow on dark objects.</p>
