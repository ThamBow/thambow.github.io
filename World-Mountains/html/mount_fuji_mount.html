      It is thought that the first ascent was in 663 by an anonymous monk. The summit has been thought of as sacred since ancient times and was forbidden to women until the Meiji Era. Ancient samurai used the base of the mountain as a remote training area, near the present day town of Gotemba. The shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo held yabusame in the area in the early Kamakura period.
      The first ascent by a foreigner was by Sir Rutherford Alcock in September 1860, from the foot of the mountain to the top in eight hours and three hours for the descent.Alcock's brief narrative in The Capital of the Tycoon was the first widely disseminated description of the mountain in the West.Lady Fanny Parkes, the wife of British ambassador Sir Harry Parkewas the first non-Japanese woman to ascend Mount Fuji in 1867.</p><br>

Fuji once—but a fool to do so twice.[16][17] It remains a popular mein Japanese culture, including making numerous movie appearances,inspiring the Infiniti logo,and even appearing in medicine with the Mount Fuji sign.As of 2006, the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the United States Marine Corps operate military bases near Mount Fuji.</p>
